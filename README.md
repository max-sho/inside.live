## Pipeline

### 1. Editor → Config + Assets

Open `editor/index.html` in a browser. The editor is a local tool — it runs entirely client-side.

**Upload assets:**
- Drop `.sog` / `.splat` / `.ply` files into the Splat Files zone
- Drop a background image (jpg/png)
- Drop a promoter logo
- Add past event images via the Past Events section

**Tune the viewer:**
- Camera, effects, post-processing, transitions — all sliders update the preview in real time

**Export:**
- **Copy JSON** — copies just the config to clipboard (no assets)
- **Export Package** — downloads a `.zip` containing:
  - `config.json` with all settings + relative asset paths
  - `assets/` folder with all uploaded files (splats, bg, logo, past images)
  - `index.html` patched with correct asset paths for standalone use

### 2. Deploy

Unzip the exported package to your hosting root. The structure is ready to serve:

```
your-domain.com/
├── index.html       ← The event page
├── config.json      ← Settings
└── assets/          ← All media
```

`index.html` loads on any static host (Vercel, Netlify, S3, GitHub Pages).

On boot, it:
1. Fetches `./config.json`
2. Reads `assets.splats[0]` → loads the 3D splat
3. Reads `assets.background` → loads and processes the background
4. Reads `event.*` → fills in all event details, lineup, past events, socials

### 3. Re-import

To edit a previously exported event:
1. Open the editor
2. Click **Import** and select either the `.zip` or the `config.json`
3. ZIP import restores all assets + settings automatically
4. JSON import restores settings only (re-upload assets manually)

## Config Schema

See `config.json` for the full schema. Key sections:

| Section | Controls |
|---------|----------|
| `event` | Name, date, venue, lineup, tickets, socials, past events |
| `viewer` | Camera orbit, zoom limits, idle sway, effects, post-processing |
| `assets` | File paths for splats, background, logo |

## Memory Mode

When a user taps a past event card, the viewer transitions to the corresponding splat:
- Splat index 0 = main event (`assets/main.sog`)
- Splat index 1+ = past events (`assets/past-1.sog`, etc.)

The transition uses the type and duration configured in the Transitions section.

Returning to Info mode transitions back to the main splat.

## Asset Requirements

| Asset | Format | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Splat | `.sog` / `.splat` / `.ply` | Generated via Sharp → 3DGS converter pipeline |
| Background | `.jpg` / `.png` | Any resolution, will be downsampled to 256×256 and blurred |
| Logo | `.png` (transparent) | Displayed at ~28px height in the hero |
| Past images | `.jpg` / `.png` | Displayed in 3-column grid, ~100×130px cards |
